# POWDER

A mirror of the open-source POWDER roguelike homebrew game that was originally developed for the Gameboy Advance. It was also ported to the Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows (and Windows Embedded), Apple Mac OS X (10.5 Leopard and later) and GNU/Linux.

There was a GCW Zero OPK created by zear, which I'll add when I can find my copy.

The game was programmed in C++ using SDL, so it's pretty portable. Well at least in theory. ðŸ˜€

## Licencing

POWDER is a 21-year-old game which exists because the author Jeff Lait was frustrated there were no roguelike games for the Gameboy Advance.

As such it has a weird Creative Commons licence. As a side note, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) do not recommend using Creative Commons for software. But as this game is only slightly older than *Quake*, I think we can forgive it.
